Requirements
------------

* node `^4.2.0`
* npm `^3.0.0`


Planned features
----------------

* CRUD
* React + Redux
* Universal
* Table with pagination, sorting, filtering/search
* Tag cloud?


Usage
-----

First start development database:

```
$ docker run --name tm-rethink -v "$PWD:/data" -p 8080:8080 -p 28015:28015 -d rethinkdb
```


* Doing live development? Use `npm start` to spin up the dev server.
* Compiling the application to disk? Use `npm run compile`.
* Deploying to an environment? `npm run deploy` can help with that.

**NOTE:** This package makes use of [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) to improve your debugging experience. For convenience, all of messages are prefixed with `app:*`. If you'd like to to change what debug statements are displayed, you can override the `DEBUG` environment variable via the CLI (e.g. `DEBUG=app:* npm start`) or tweak the npm scripts (`betterScripts` in `package.json`).


|Script|Description|
|---|---|
|`npm start`|Spins up Koa server to serve your app at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled in development.|
|`npm run compile`|Compiles the application to disk (`~/dist` by default).|
|`npm run dev`|Same as `npm start`, but enables nodemon to automatically restart the server when server-related code is changed.|
|`npm run dev:nw`|Same as `npm run dev`, but opens the redux devtools in a new window.|
|`npm run dev:no-debug`|Same as `npm run dev` but disables redux devtools.|
|`npm run test`|Runs unit tests with Karma and generates a coverage report.|
|`npm run test:dev`|Runs Karma and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.|
|`npm run deploy`|Runs linter, tests, and then, on success, compiles your application to disk.|
|`npm run flow:check`|Analyzes the project for type errors.|
|`npm run lint`|Lint all `.js` files.|
|`npm run lint:fix`|Lint and fix all `.js` files. [Read more on this](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html#fix).|

**NOTE:** Deploying to a specific environment? Make sure to specify your target `NODE_ENV` so webpack will use the correct configuration. For example: `NODE_ENV=production npm run compile` will compile your application with `~/build/webpack/_production.js`.

Testing
-------

To add a unit test, simply create a `.spec.js` file anywhere in `~/tests`. Karma will pick up on these files automatically.

Coverage reports will be compiled to `~/coverage` by default. If you wish to change what reporters are used and where reports are compiled, you can do so by modifying `coverage_reporters` in `~/config/_base.js`.

Deployment
----------

`npm run compile` (make sure to specify your target `NODE_ENV` as well).
